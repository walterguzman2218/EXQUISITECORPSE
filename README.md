#The ExquisiteCorpse Stories#

###**Exquisite corpse**, also known as *exquisite cadaver* was hatched in 1925 by the Surrealists André Breton, Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, and Marcel Duchamp during one of their ritual hangouts on Paris’s Rue du Château###

###Breton had effectively founded the movement a year prior, formalizing it with his 1924 *Surrealist Manifesto*.###
###That text called for art that engaged the unconscious by using dreams and automatic drawings as creative fodder.###
